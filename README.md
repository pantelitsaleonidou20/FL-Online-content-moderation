# FL Online content moderation

This is the repository of the scripts used for the experimental evaluation of the work "Privacyâ€“Preserving Online Content Moderation: A Federated
Learning Use Case".

Steps:

# 1. Access the Datasets
The datasets we used in our evaluation can be access after sending a request for access to the owners of the datasets e.g. for
the Abusive Dataset send an access request using the following link https://zenodo.org/record/3706866#.Y90_X-xBxJU.

# 2. Data preprocessing
The script preprocess_dataset.py contains the code used for preprocessing the tweet texts to prepare the data for the training task.

# 3. Differential Private Federated Learing Simulation
The script FL_scrip.py contains the code used for 

a) splitting the preprocessed dataset to train and test sets
b) distribute the train data to a number of clients -- simulate the federated train set
c) prepare the settings for the DP-FL simulation
d) execute the DP-FL training
f) evalaute the global model
