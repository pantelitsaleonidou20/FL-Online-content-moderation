# FL Online content moderation

This is the repository of the scripts used for the experimental evaluation of the work "Privacyâ€“Preserving Online Content Moderation: A Federated
Learning Use Case".

Steps:

# 1. Access the Datasets
The datasets we used in our evaluation can be access after sending a request for access to the owners of the datasets e.g. for
the Abusive Dataset send an access request using the following link https://zenodo.org/record/3706866#.Y90_X-xBxJU.

# 2. Data preprocessing
The script preprocess_dataset.py contains the code used for preprocessing the tweet texts to prepare the data for the training task.
The preprocessing steps are the following:
 1. removing tags;
 2. removing links;
 3. removing numbers;
 4. removing punctuation;
 5. removing non-ascii characters;
 6. converting to lowercase;
 7. removing white spaces other than single space;
 8. removing numbers;
 9. removing English stop words;

# 3. GloVe Word Vectors: 

Visit the website (https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/) and download the pre-trained word vectors:
Twitter (2B tweets, 27B tokens, 1.2M vocab, uncased, 25d, 50d, 100d, & 200d vectors, 1.42 GB download).

We use the 200d GloVe vectors in our simulation. So you need to unzip the downloaded file, and get the file path to the 200d vectors file which is used in the FL_script.py.

# 4. Differential Private Federated Learing Simulation
The script FL_scrip.py contains the code used for:

1) splitting the preprocessed dataset to train and test sets

2) distribute the train data to a number of clients -- simulate the federated train set

3) prepare the settings for the DP-FL simulation

4) execute the DP-FL training

5) evalaute the global model

For (3) and (4) we follow the following tensorflow federated tutorials: 
1. https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/tutorials/federated_learning_for_image_classification (for Federated Learning simulation)
2. https://www.tensorflow.org/federated/tutorials/federated_learning_with_differential_privacy (for the addition of Differential Privacy guarantees)

5. Run the FL simulation multiple times and store the results of each repetition in a seperate file, using the script "run_multiple_times.py"
